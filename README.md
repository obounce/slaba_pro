# slaba_pro

A new flutter plugin project.

Made by Samuel Adekunle x O'Bounce Technologies,

Install and import the package. Then just customize its parameters.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  slaba_pro: ^1.0.1
```

Make use of the package like this:

```dart
  OneAppPlugin().getPaymentUI(
    context,
    amount: 1000.00,
    email: 'example@mail.net',
    currency: 'NGN',
    firstName: 'Samuel',
    lastName: 'Adekunle',
    phoneNumber: '09011111111',
    secretKey: 'secret-key-0000000XXXXXXX',
  );
```

No other configuration requiredâ€”the plugin works out of the box.
